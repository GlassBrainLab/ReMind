   The history of film began in the 1890s, with the invention of motion picture cameras and the establishment of film production companies. The films of the 1890s were under a minute long and until 1927, motion pictures were produced without sound. The first eleven years of motion pictures show the cinema moving from a novelty to an established large-scale entertainment industry. The minutes became several films long consisting of several shots. The first rotating camera for taking panning shots was built in 1897. The first film studios were built in 1897. Special effects were introduced and film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, began to be used. In 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was achieved and the close-up shot was introduced. The first animation use in movies was in 1899. The first feature length multi-reel film was a 1906 Australian production. New film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and low-key lighting for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes. As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel and be easier to be understood by the audience, the audience that was new to this form. Genres began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were further subdivided. The years of the First World War were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmed to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices. By 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another.

   The films of the 1890s were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in theater programs. A film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene, authentic or staged, of everyday life, a public event, or a sporting event. There was little to no cinematic technique, usually no camera movement, and flat compositions reminiscent of the stage. The films were in black and white. Until 1927 motion pictures for sound were produced without films. This era is referred to as the silent era of film. To enhance the viewer's experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra, a theatre organ, and sometimes sound effects and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, intertitles came to be use. Illustrated songs were a notable exception to this trend that began in 1894 in theater houses and persisted as late as the late 1930s in film theaters. Live performance or sound recordings were paired with hand-colored glass slides projected through slide projectors and similar devices. In this way, song narrative was illustrated through a series of slides whose changes were simultaneous with the narrative development. The main song of illustrated purpose was to encourage sheet music sales and they were highly successful with sales reaching into millions for a single song. Later with the birth of film, illustrated songs were used as filler material preceding films and during reel changes. The year 1900 conveniently marks the emergence of the first motion pictures that can be considered as 'films' - at this point, film-makers begin to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative.

   The first films to consist of more than one shot appeared toward the end of the 19th century, a notable example was the French film of the life of Jesus Christ. These weren't represented as a continuous film; the separate scenes were interspersed with lantern slides, a lecture, and live choral numbers, to increase the running time of the spectacle to about 90 minutes. Another example of this is the reproductions of scenes from the Greco-Turkish war, made by Georges Melies in 1897. Although each scene was sold separately, they were shown one after the other by the exhibitors. Even his film "Cinderella" in 1898 contained no action moving from one shot to the next one. To understand what was going on in the film, the audience had to know their stories beforehand, or be told them by a presenter. Real film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer Robert W. Paul's "Come Along, Do!", made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot. In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an art exhibition having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's "Cinematograph Camera No. 1" of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and multiple exposures. This first was technique used in his 1901 film "Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost."

   In 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by George Albert Smith and James Williamson, who also worked in Brighton. In that year Smith made "As Seen Through a Telescope", in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old telescope observes this through a man. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is James Williamson's "Attack on a China Mission Station" (1900). The first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to a missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the balcony, who come and rescue them. The film also used the first "reverse angle" cut in film history, with opposite viewpoints back-to-back. With the worldwide film boom, yet more countries now joined Britain, France, Germany and the United States in serious film production. In Italy, production was spread over several centers, with Turin being the first and biggest. There, Ambrosio was the first company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period. The great strength of the Italian industry was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, Giovanni Pastrone's two-reel "The Fall of Troy" made a big impression worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger spectacles like "Where are you going?" (1912), which ran for 90 minutes.

   The most important film-producing country in Northern Europe up until the First World War was Denmark. The Nordisk company was set up there in 1906 by Ole Olsen, a fairground showman, and after a brief period imitating the successes of French and British filmmakers, in 1907 he produced 67 films, most directed by Viggo Larsen, with sensational subjects like "The White Slave", "Polar Bear Hunt" and "The Lion Hunt". By 1910, new smaller Danish companies began joining the business, and besides making more films about the white slave trade, they contributed other new subjects. By 1912, the Danish film companies were multiplying rapidly. In Germany, Oskar Messter had been involved in film-making from 1896, but did not make a significant films of number per year until 1910. When the worldwide film boom started, he, and the few other people in the German film business, continued to sell prints of their own films outright, which put them at a disadvantage. It was only when Paul Davidson, the owner of a chain of cinemas, brought Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad to Germany from Denmark in 1911, and set up a production company, that a change-over to renting prints began. Messter replied with a series of longer films starring Henny Porten, but although these did well in the German-speaking world, they were not particularly successful internationally, unlike the Asta Nielsen films. Altogether, German producers only had a minor part of the German market in 1914.

   At the start of the First World War, French and Italian cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries. The American industry, or "Hollywood", as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in California, gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its countries to most product. By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 feature films annually, 82% of the global total. The comedies of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the swashbuckling adventures of Douglas Fairbanks and the romances of Clara Bow, to cite just a few examples, made these performers' faces well-known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical continuity editing was developed and exported - although its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong realist traditions in art and drama, such as Japan. This development was contemporary with the growth of the studio system and its greatest publicity method, the star system, which characterized American film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries. The studios' efficient, top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication. At the same time, the system's commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous escapism discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree, a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic Erich von Stroheim in the late teens and the '20s. 

   Warners released "The Jazz Singer" during late 1927, which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film; but this process was actually accomplished first by Charles Taze Russell in 1914 with the lengthy film "The Photo-Drama of Creation". This drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with phonograph records of talks and music. The early sound-on-disc processes such as Vitaphone were soon superseded by sound-on-film methods like Fox Movietone, DeForest Phonofilm, and RCA Photophone. The industrialists convinced the largely reluctant trend that "talking pictures", or "talkies", were the future. The change was remarkably swift. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world, principally for economic reasons. Cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like China and Japan, where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s, indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries, like Wu Yonggang's "The Goddess" (China, 1934) and Yasujiro Ozu's "I Was Born, But..." (Japan, 1932). But even in Japan, a figure such as the "benshi", the live cinema who was a major part of Japanese silent narrator, found his acting career was ending. Sound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained.

   In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the Great Depression. Thus began what is now often called "The Golden Age of Hollywood", which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s. The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period. The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars, such as Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s, child performer Shirley Temple. Creatively, however, the rapid transition was a difficult one, and in some ways, film briefly reverted to conditions of its earliest days. The late '20s were full of static, stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to utilize the new medium. Many stage performers, directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling. Many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended. This awkward period was fairly short-lived. 1929 was a watershed year: William Wellman with "Chinatown Nights" and "The Man I Love", Rouben Mamoulian with "Applause", Alfred Hitchcock with "Blackmail" (Britain's first sound feature), were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound. In this, they both benefited from, and pushed further, technical cameras in microphones and advances, and capabilities for editing, post-synchronizing sound (rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming). Sound films emphasized black history and different genres more than silents did.
